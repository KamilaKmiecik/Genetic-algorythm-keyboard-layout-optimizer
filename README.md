# Genetic-algorythm-keyboard-layout-optimizer

This is a program written in C# that uses a genetic algorithm to optimize keyboard layout. The program starts by generating a population of random keyboard layouts. Each layout is represented as a list of characters, where each character corresponds to a key on the keyboard. The fitness of each layout is determined by evaluating its "placement cost" (the difficulty of typing each key) and the frequency of each letter in the English language. The genetic algorithm then selects parents based on fitness, performs crossover and mutation operations to create a new population, and repeats this process for a given number of generations.  The program uses several helper functions, including GeneratePopulation which generates a list of random keyboard layouts, Fitness which calculates the fitness of a given layout, PopulationFitness which calculates the fitness of an entire population, CreateParents which selects parents based on fitness, EdgeRecombinationCrossover which performs crossover, and MutationChangeRandomLetter and MutationChangeReverse which perform mutation.  The program prints the best fitness and corresponding layout for each generation, and updates the population by replacing the old population with the new children population
